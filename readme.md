# LED Constellation Star map

This project is part of the [2023 100 ideas project](https://blog.abluestar.com/projects/2023-100-ideas/), [Idea 012 - LED Constellation Star map](https://blog.abluestar.com/idea012-led-constellation-star-map/)

The idea is to have a map of constellations using addressable RGB LEDs for the stars. Then program the LEDs so that they twinkle, and the brightness and color temperature matches the corresponding star.

I originally started this project thinking it would be an easy 4 hour, one night project but it ended up taking 8 hours. The mouse bites took up 4 hours alone.

The board is panelized in such a way that it can be displayed as a single board with data and power lines snaking through the mouse bites. This allows for the entire panel to be displayed as a single board using a single microcontroller.

The constellations can also be broken out of the panel and used individually. Each of the corners have a grounded though hold that can be sewn into garment, and through holes to connect a microcontroller.

There are 88 commonly recognizable constellations. I could not fit all the constellations on a single board with a reasonable price. I arbitrarily selected 19 constellations in the northern hemisphere that I liked.

As always open to suggestions
